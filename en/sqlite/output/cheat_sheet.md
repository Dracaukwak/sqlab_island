## Adventure

### Episode 1

**Token.** 042.

Copy-paste the previous query. After the star `*`, add a comma and the given formula. Execute the complete query.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM village
```

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
```

### Episode 3

**Token.** 134232424188549.

Copy-paste the previous query, add the given formula, and execute it.

**Formula**. `salt_048(sum(hash) OVER ()) AS token`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly'
    AND job LIKE '%smith'

_Tip._ In former queries, the * stands for: all columns. Instead of the star, you can also address one or more columns (separated by a comma) and you will only get the columns you need.

**Formula**. `salt_090(sum(hash) OVER ()) AS token`

```sql
INSERT INTO inhabitant (name, villageid, gender, job, gold, state)

SET owner = 20
WHERE item = 'coffee cup';


SELECT *
FROM item
```

Find a friendly inhabitant who is either a merchant or a dealer. Maybe they want to buy some of your items.

**Formula**. `salt_024(sum(hash) OVER ()) AS token`

With a logical `OR`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly'
    AND (job = 'merchant' OR job = 'dealer')
```

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly'
    AND job in ('merchant', 'dealer')

```sql
UPDATE inhabitant
SET gold = gold - 120
WHERE personid = 15;

Copy-paste the previous query, add the given formula, and execute it.

**Formula**. `salt_029(sum(A.hash + B.hash) OVER ()) AS token`

The expression presented here is called a join. It combines the information of the `inhabitant`
table with information of the `village` table by matching `villageid` values.

```sql
SELECT A.name
FROM village A
JOIN inhabitant B ON A.villageid = B.villageid
WHERE B.name = 'Dirty Dieter'
```

Implicit `JOIN`. You may encounter a syntax where the join conditions are mixed with the filter conditions. This can make the query harder to understand, especially as the number of tables and conditions increases. While this method is still supported for backward compatibility, it is generally considered outdated. The explicit JOIN syntax is recommended for new SQL code.

```sql
SELECT A.name
FROM village A, inhabitant B
WHERE A.villageid = B.villageid
  AND B.name = 'Dirty Dieter'
```

### Episode 23

```sql
SELECT B.name
FROM village A
JOIN inhabitant B ON A.chief = B.personid
WHERE A.name = 'Onionville'
```

### Episode 24

Shall I tell you how many women there are in Onionville? Nah, you can figure it out by yourself!

_Tip._ Women show up as gender = 'f'.

**Formula** (replace the emoji üëÄ with this number). `salt_032(üëÄ + sum(avg(A.hash + B.hash)) OVER ()) AS token`

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS women
FROM inhabitant A
JOIN village B ON A.villageid = B.villageid
    AND B.name = 'Onionville'
    AND gender = 'f'
```
