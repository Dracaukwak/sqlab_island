## Adventure

### Episode 1

**Token.** `call decrypt(042)`

Copy-paste the previous query. After the star `*`, add a comma and the given formula. Execute the complete query.

**Formula**. `salt_042(sum(hash) OVER ()) AS token`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM village
```

### Episode 2

FROM inhabitant
```

### Episode 3

**Token.** `call decrypt(128589543210724)`

Copy-paste the previous query, add the given formula, and execute it.

**Formula**. `salt_048(sum(hash) OVER ()) AS token`

FROM inhabitant A
WHERE job = 'butcher'
```

### Episode 4

**Token.** `call decrypt(280206676651511)`

Okay, let's see who is friendly on this island...

**Formula**. `salt_023(sum(hash) OVER ()) AS token`

**Formula**. `salt_090(sum(hash) OVER ()) AS token`

```sql
INSERT INTO inhabitant (name, villageid, gender, job, gold, state)
VALUES ('Stranger', 1, '?', '?', 0, '?');
