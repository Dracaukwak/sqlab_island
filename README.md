# üèù SQLab Island

## Credits

This is an adaptation of [SQL Island](https://sql-island.informatik.uni-kl.de), a simple game designed to teach SQL, distributed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) on [GitHub](https://github.com/jschildgen/sql-island) by its main author, [Johannes Schildgen](https://www.johannesschildgen.de) (Regensburg University of Applied Sciences, Germany). 

The original game was adapted by Aristide Grange (University of Lorraine, France) to demonstrate the use of SQL Adventure Builder, or SQLab, a system enabling teachers to create standalone educational games for learning SQL. This system lives in a [separate repository](https://github.com/laowantong/sqlab).

## Disclaimer and potential issues

The present adaptation of SQL Island includes a few changes in the game's content to be compatible with SQLab. Any bug or problem is the sole responsibility of the adapter, and should be reported in the [issues of SQLab](https://github.com/laowantong/sqlab/issues) itself.
